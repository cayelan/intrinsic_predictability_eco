## Instructions

### Simulations

The `Simulations` folder contains files to reproduce the logistic and Ricker map simulations and the associated EDM forecasts. 

### Empirical analysis

All analyses were done in `R`. The data to reproduce the empirical analyses is available in the `Data` folder. 
Please cite the datasets according to the references provided in the article and the reproducible reports.

The `Code` folder contains an RMD file to reproduce the analysis and an R script to calculate permutation entropy.
A reproducible report for the empirical analysis is also available as pdfs in the `Report` folder and all result figures
 are in the folder `Figs`.
